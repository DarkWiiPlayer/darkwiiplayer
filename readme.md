## Projects

### [Restia](https://github.com/darkwiiplayer/restia)

Lua library for the server-side of your web projects.

The current project structure is a bit of a clusterfuck but it is slowly being
refactored into something decent.

### [DarkWiiPlayer/JS](https://github.com/darkwiiplayer/js)

A repository of JavaScript snippets slowly turned into a front-end
micro-framework over time. [Documentation](https://darkwiiplayer.github.io/js/)

### Just a bunch of smaller Lua libraries

- [`arrr`](https://github.com/DarkWiiPlayer/arrr) for commandline argument parsing
- [`shapeshift`](https://github.com/DarkWiiPlayer/shapeshift) for data validations and transformations
- [`lumber`](https://github.com/DarkWiiPlayer/lumber) for logging
- [`scaffold`](https://github.com/DarkWiiPlayer/scaffold) for filesystem scaffolding
- [`skooma`](https://github.com/DarkWiiPlayer/skooma) for HTML generation (also ported to JS)
- [`streamcsv`](https://github.com/DarkWiiPlayer/streamcsv) for performant CSV reading

This repo is not just for the front-page.
I also keep a bunch of stuff here that may or may not be of interest to other
people like a short list of worthwile books, papers and blog posts;
a few file templates, etc.
