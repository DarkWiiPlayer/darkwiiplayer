## Projects

### [Restia](https://github.com/darkwiiplayer/restia)

Build web-applications in Lua (maybe also static webpages in the future).

The current project structure is a bit of a clusterfuck but it is slowly being
refactored into something decent.

## Talk to me about:

- Programming
- Games
- Anime
- Anything nerdy, really

## Find me on:

- The [Lua Scripters](https://discord.gg/7wu7ZsW) discord server
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DarkWiiPlayer)
- [My website](https://darkwiiplayer.com), whenever I get that updated
- [Dev.to](https://dev.to/darkwiiplayer)

This repo is not just for the front-page.
I also keep a bunch of stuff here that may or may not be of interest to other
people like a short list of worthwile books, papers and blog posts; a few
file templates, etc.
