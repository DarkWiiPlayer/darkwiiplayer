# Books, Blogs and Others

This is a list of resources I've found on the internet that seemed somewhat
interesting.
That includes (mostly) books, but also blog posts, papers, etc.
Link may not be canonical.
This is not a list of stuff I've read;
most likely, it's things that I want to read at some point
or just wanted to save in case I ever need them.

## Books

### [97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/index.html)

> Pearls of wisdom for programmers collected from leading practitioners.

### [Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/)

Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra – Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares
Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe

> This book is used as the textbook for the course EE103 (Stanford) and EE133A (UCLA), where you will find additional related material.

### [Mathematics and Computation](https://www.math.ias.edu/files/Website03-25-19.pdf)

> Here is just one tip of the iceberg we’ll explore in this book: How much time does it take to find the prime factors of a 1,000-digit integer?

### [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/)

Not much to say about this, everyone should have read SICP.

### [The Algorithm Design Manual](http://mimoza.marmara.edu.tr/~msakalli/cse706_12/SkienaTheAlgorithmDesignManual.pdf)

> Most professional programmers that I’ve encountered are not well prepared to tackle algorithm design problems. This is a pity, because the techniques of algorithm design form one of the core practical technologies of computer science.
