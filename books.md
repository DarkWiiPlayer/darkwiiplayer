# Books, Blogs and Others

This is a list of resources I've found on the internet that seemed somewhat
interesting.
That includes (mostly) books, but also blog posts, papers, etc.
Link may not be canonical.
This is not a list of stuff I've read;
most likely, it's things that I want to read at some point
or just wanted to save in case I ever need them.
